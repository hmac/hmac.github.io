  <h2>About Me</h2>
  I'm a software developer living in London. Formerly at
  <a href="https://gocardless.com">GoCardless</a>, currently researching
  subtyping in dependent type theories at Royal Holloway University. I'm
  interested in language design, building software that goes wrong less
  often, doing more with less code, and discovering cool patterns in things. 
  I'm <code>harry@hmac.dev</code>, and on <a
    href="https://github.com/hmac">GitHub</a>.
