  <h2>About Me</h2>
  I'm a software developer living in London. Formerly at <a href="https://gocardless.com">GoCardless</a>
  and <a href="https://hackworthltd.uk">Hackworth</a>, I'm currently working on
   the <a href="https://codeql.github.com/">CodeQL</a> static analysis tool.
   I'm interested in language design, building software that goes wrong less
   often, doing more with less code, and discovering interesting patterns.
   I'm <code>harry@hmac.dev</code>, and on <a href="https://github.com/hmac">GitHub</a>.
